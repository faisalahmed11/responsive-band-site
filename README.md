### my-process

following mobile first approach, using flex-box and relative units for responsiveness, and animating some stuff with @keyframe, and finally completing it using @media query.

### what-i-learned

As you know, practice is the only way of getting hands on best practices, therefore as I practice, I learn how to practice more. How to write more clean and optimized code.

### Built with
